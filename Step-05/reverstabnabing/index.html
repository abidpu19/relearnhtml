    <p>
      Reverse Tabnabbing is an attack where the linked page can control the
      parent page and can rewrite it without the notice of the original user.
      The changed page looks similar to the original one. This may lead to one
      form of phishing attack where an attacker can steal authentication data or
      any sensitive information from the user. This attack is mostly possible if
      a user is in an unsecured network like a public wifi hotspot. It is also
      possible if the user URL has HTTPS, an attacker has to spoof only the site
      that is being linked to
