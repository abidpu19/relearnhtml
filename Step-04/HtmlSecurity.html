    <h1>What is HTML Security?</h1>
    <p>
      As web developers, we need to take care of writing preventive measures for
      all possible vulnerabilities in web pages. As we use HTML for designing
      web pages, we should be aware of all possible vulnerabilities in this
      language. Let us now see what are the security risks possible in HTML
    </p>

      <h2>HTML Security</h2>
      <p>
        As HTML applications are web-based applications, developers should take
        proper measures to safeguard the stored data and communications. An
        attacker can inject some malicious code via Bluetooth/wifi/text messages
        for mobile-based apps or via advertisements/emails for web-based apps.
        This malicious code can capture sensitive information and can expose it
        to the attacker or it can run some undesired operations internally like
        sending false messages or purchasing a product with zero amount etc.

        The following is the list of a few vulnerabilities that are possible in
        HTML:
        <li>HTML Injection</li>
        <li>Clickjacking</li>
        <li>HTML5 attributes and events vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Web Storage Vulnerability</li>
        <li>Reverse Tabnabbing</li>

      <h1>HTML Injection</h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes users will observe some unexpected data getting rendered on a
        web page. This might be due to a lack of proper validation for input and
        output on that page. So, a web developer should always check if input
        and output are properly validated before getting rendered on a page as
        this can lead to HTML injection attacks.
