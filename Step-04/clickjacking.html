    <h1>Introduction to Clickjacking</h1>
    <p>
      Hackers will have several ways to trick the user and make them click on
      something which they are not supposed to. A common form of this attack
      involves mirroring a login form on a website. Users will think that they
      are entering values in the actual HTML form but they are actually entering
      them in the form fields that are overlaid on that web page. The data which
      the user enters will be sent directly to an attacker's page. In this type
      of attack, hackers will usually target sensitive data like passwords, bank
      account information, credit card information, etc.,
    </p>

      <h2>Real-time scenarios of clickjacking attacks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There was an attack on one of the popular browser plugins, where an
          attacker added a modified page in an iframe and can trick a user into
          changing settings of the plugin to get access to the local system's
          resources such as a microphone, camera, etc
        </li>
        <li>
          A popular social networking site was attacked by tricking users to
          click on a button that will make them retweet the location of the
          malicious web page which will be propagated hugely
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>What is Clickjacking</h2>
      <p>
        It is an attack where an attacker uses low iframes with low opaqueness
        or transparent layers to trick users into clicking on something somewhat
        diverse from what they actually see on the page. Thus an attacker is
        hijacking clicks which will execute some malicious code and hence the
        name 'Clickjacking'. It is also known as UI redressing or iframe
        overlay. For example, on a social networking website, a clickjacking
        attack leads to an unauthorized user spamming the entire network of your
        friends by sending some false messages.
      </p>
      <h2>How is Clickjacking Performed</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Attackers load a target web page inside a low opacity iframe and on
          top of that iframe, the attacker's web page will be rendered with a
          clickable button or link.
        </li>
        <li>
          When a user clicks on that button or link of the rendered web page, it
          triggers actions on the invisible page. The invisible page might be a
          malicious web page or a legitimate web page, which the user did not
          intend to visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          The end user will have no idea that a click has been made on the
          invisible page and without the user's knowledge actions are performed
          on the attacker's web page
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Methods to prevent the attack</h2>
      <p>
        <b> Client-side methods:</b> The most common method is to prevent the
        webpages from being displayed within a frame which is known as
        frame-buster or frame-killer. Though this method is effective in a few
        cases it is not considered a best practice as it can be easily bypassed.
      </p>
      <pre style="background-color: darksalmon">
        &lt;script&gt; // frame busting if (self == top) {
        document.documentElement.style.visibility = "visible"; } else {
        top.location = self.location; } function register() {
        alert("Registered"); } &lt;script&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
        <b>Server-side methods:</b> Security experts recommend server-side
        methods to be the most effective methods to defend against clickjacking.
        Below are the two response headers to deal with this
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Using X-Frame-Options response header.</li>
        <li>Using Content Security Policy(CSP) response header.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>X-Frame-Options:</h2>
      <p>
        It is a response header that is to be set as part of the HTTP response
        of a web page. It specifies whether a browser should be permitted to
        show a web page inside a &lt;frame&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt; tag
      </p>
      <ul>
        The below values can be set for the X-Frame-Options header:
        <li>
          <b> SAMEORIGIN : </b>This choice permits the current page to be
          displayed in a frame on another page, but only within the current
          domain
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> DENY </b> This choice does not permit any domain to render the
          current page within a frame. This is the most secure option to provide
          restriction
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ALLOW-FROM URI</b> allows the current page to be displayed in a
          frame, but only in a specific URI for example,
          www.example.com/frame-page
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Content-Security-Policy (CSP):</h2>
    </div>
  </body>
