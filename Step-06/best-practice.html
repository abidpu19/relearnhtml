    <h1>Best Practices For Creating Web Pages</h1>
    <h2>
      The following are some best practices to be followed while developing a
      web page or an application using HTML5.
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        n the application, ensure that each web page is having proper document
        structure with divisions such as &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt,
        &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that correct DOCTYPE is declared, which is required for the
        browser to understand the standards of the application used to render it
        properly.
      </li>
      <li>Use a meaningful title for the web pages.</li>
      <li>Always close the tag even if it is not a container tag.</li>
      <li>
        Avoid Inline styles and embedded scripts. Try to include script and
        style with external files keeping your HTML code clean and neat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Include the script as an external file and place this code at the end
        portion of the &lt;body&gt; tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the lang attribute to the root element, and keep the value as short
        as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even though HTML is case insensitive, using lowercase for code is the
        best practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the most appropriate HTML tag for sectioning the web page. Try to
        avoid the generic &lt;div&gt; tag and use more meaningful tags such as
        &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt; and appropriate tags in the web pages.
      </li>
      <li>Always use &lt;ul&gt; for designing navigation bars.</li>
      <li>
        Avoid the use of the 'type' attribute in the HTML list element and use
        the corresponding CSS property list-style-type property instead
      </li>
      <li>
        On embedding elements to the web page, use the alt attribute with a
        proper description text.
      </li>
      <li>Indent nested elements properly.</li>
      <li>
        Use appropriate type attribute for Input element inside forms, also
        ensure the form control is wrapped with &lt;label&gt; element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a sandbox attribute along with the iframe element whenever it is
        needed to embed another webpage into the application
      </li>
      <li>
        Use rel attribute with a value "noopener noreferrer" along with
        hyperlink, to avoid reverse tabnabbing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider all the input data as untrusted information and sanitize those
        inputs before it is used in some logic in the application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do proper output encoding to avoid chances of injection of malicious
        code to the application through input elements
      </li>
    </ol>
